# Programmeer Project

### What problem will be solved for the user
### What features will be available to solve the problem
### An overview sketch of what the application will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out
### What data sets and data sources will you need, how you will get the data into the right form for your app
### What separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the problem) and how these should work together
### What external components (APIs) you need to make certain features possible
### Technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these
### A review of similar applications or visualizations in terms of features and technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)
